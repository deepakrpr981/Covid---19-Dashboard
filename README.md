# Project OverView
It has been more than a year since the outbreak of COVID, and the situation keeps up and down. We always want to keep an eye on the numbers and check how things going: are things getting better? when could be the next overseas travelling? when will the quarantine end? To track the trends and get customized visualisations, we can easily do it with Power BI. In this article, I will show you how to connect your Power BI dashboard to the data from GitHub, how to transform and clean the data merge, removing negative values adding additional columns, EDA, ETL using python pandas and Power Query Editor, then finally create dashboard using power Bi

# 3. Data Gathering -
Python script for web scraping COVID-19 data from a webpage. This example uses BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape data from the Worldometer website, which is a common source for COVID-19 statistics.
